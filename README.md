# chant
**A small command line toy written in C**<br/>
<sub>This is my first project written in C, minor bugs are expected.<sub>

## Compilation
I reccomend using [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for compiling. You can paste `gcc chant.c -o chant` into your terminal to compile.<br/>
<sub>*make sure you're in the same directory as the file!*<sub>

## Usage
Once chant has been compiled, the executable can be run with `./chant`.<br/><br/>
**Do note:**
1. Chant will not accept alphabetical characters or strings
2. Depending on the maximum length of integers your device supports, chant may not accept some lengthy numbers
