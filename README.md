# chant
**A small command line toy written in C**<br/>
<sub>This is my first project written in C, minor bugs are expected.<sub>

## Compilation
I reccomend using [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for compiling. You can paste `gcc chant.c -o chant` into your terminal to compile.<br/>
<sub>*make sure you're in the same directory as the file!*<sub>

## Usage
Once chant has been compiled, the executable can be run with `./chant`.<br/><br/>
**Do note:**
1. Chant will not accept alphabetical characters or strings
2. Chant may not accept some lengthy integers, due to limitations with the code
3. Chant can be compiled on Windows, however there's no garuntee it'll function as intended
